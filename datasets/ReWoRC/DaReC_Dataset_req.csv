570;OTR-570;Adopt a metadata standard that is compliant with Federal regulations. The current Federal standards for spatial data are the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version 2.0), FGDC-STD-001-1998.

If this occurs, the CEAP database team will evaluate conversion of metadata.;2006 - stewards.pdf;Funcional
571;OTR-571;Implement a metadata input tool that supports creating and editing of metadata in the chosen format. The metadata tool will allow for local and web-based input and editing.

584;OTR-584;Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases. Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less. Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met. In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data;2006 - stewards.pdf;No funcional

587;OTR-587;STEWARDS will follow industry best practices for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication. Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are. This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated. This is primarily done through userids and passwords;2006 - stewards.pdf;No funcional

589;OTR-589;The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product. Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system. Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process. The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.;2006 - stewards.pdf;No funcional
590;OTR-590;The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability. The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not less than 50% of working hours in any week). For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components. Intentional “denial of service attacks” is not foreseen as a significant concern.;2006 - stewards.pdf;No funcional
