The folder PROMISE contains the python notebooks and .py files with which the operation and performance of the dataset PROMISE has been tested.

- promise-test-stratified.ipynb tests the training of the models when PROMISE dataset is stratified in 10 folds. 
- promise-test-by-docs.ipynb tests the training of the models when PROMISE dataset is divided by documents.

The folder ReWoRC contains the python notebooks and .py files with which the operation and performance of the dataset ReWoRC has been tested.

- rework-test-stratified.ipynb tests the training of the models when ReWoRC dataset is stratified in 10 folds.
- rework-test-by-docs.ipynb tests the training of the models when ReWoRC dataset is divided by documents.
- rework-test-by-topics.ipynb tests the training of the models when ReWoRC dataset is divided by topics.
- rework-test-with-problem-statements.ipynb tests again the training of the models when ReWoRC dataset is stratified in 10 folds with the difference that the statement of the problem to be solved is added to the requirements.

The file [...] calculates the means, standard deviations and best learning rates for the results obtained.
