This section contains all the data collected after training BeRT, DeBERTa and RoBERTa language models, so the user can compare the results obtained.

The most representative data have been collected when measuring the reliability and performance of each model with each dataset and each test environment: f1-score, recall and precision in predicting whether a requirement is functional or non-functional.

The mean and standard deviation of each of these parameters has been calculated, as each experiment is repeated between 6 and 10 times with different datasets for training, validation and testing.
