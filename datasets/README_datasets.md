This folder contains all the datasets used for the test section.

.xlsx archives are used to manipulate data in a visual and usable enviroment. .csv archives are the data with which we train our models in the test section.

 - DaReC_Dataset_enunciados.csv contains the problem statements. The statements are long and have line breaks so CSV format deforms the content of this file. However, when downloaded it works perfectly at training the models.
 - DaReC_Dataset_req.csv contains the functional and non functional requirements from DaReC dataset.
 - NFR_PROMISE contains the functional and non functional requirements from PROMISE dataset.
